1.1 – Airlines Delay
Summary:
- From this Dashboard, we can see in detail the Delay summary by Airline. It seems
that Southwest Airlines Co. (WN) is the Airline with the longest delay, both in arrivals
and departures.
- Saturday and Sundays are the days with fewer flights and coincide with the days of
the week with the lowest percentage of delay.
Design:
- I use a Text Table to give a summary of the numbers we are dealing. It helped me to
better understand the quantity ranges.
- Secondly, I chose to use a Tree Map because visually is easier to see the total
SUM(of Arrival and Departure) according to the size of the box. It helps us to answer
the question: Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?
- There is an Airline filter next to the title of the Tree Map and a Single Value List with
the two options (Arrival and Departure)
- I picked orange and blue colours because it represents better the highest and lowest
values and is adapted for colour-blind people.
- Finally, two Line Charts representing the Arrival and departure Delay per day of the
week. It is better to understand the percentages of the delay per day.
- We can use the different graph to filter the information more accurate on what we
want to know.
1.2 – Airports Delay
Summary:
- From this second Dashboard, we have a similar approach with the details. In this
case we can see the summary divided in Meteorological Season by Airport. Being
Summer and Winter the seasons with the higher percentage of delay. And Autumn is
the season with a significant diminution of flights.
- As we can observe, Chicago O’Hare International Airport is the Airport with the
longest delay in most of the seasons (Summer, Fall and Winter) Interestingly, Dallas
is the airport with the longest delay during Spring.
- Something else that caught the attention is the activity
Design:
- As the first Insight, I decided to use a Text Table because for me is clearer to
understand the data we are digging in. The colours (orange and blue) were based on
the percentage of delay.
- The second graph was a Packed Bubble filtering by the top 10 Airports, in my point
of view is easier to identify which circles are the largest (The longest delays of
Arrivals and Departures), it catch the viewer attention.
- A Tree Map was used to measure the most problematical Airport. As I mentioned
before, I think it’s a good way to find the answer to this question: Which airlines or
airports have the worst delays?
- I found that a good way of visualizing and understanding the delay flow is by using a
Symbol Map with the different dates and adding colours depending on the time of
interruption.
- I add a filter of the airports on top of the sheet.
2 – Delay Motives
Summary:
- Visually we can distinguish that Late Aircraft is the three principal motives for the
Delay are Late Aircraft, Airline and Air System. The weather has less impact than the
previous mentioned and the Security doesn’t have a lot of impact on the time.
Design:
- In this situation we are comparing data so I decided to use two Bar Charts with the
details of each Airport and Airline so we can understand better what is the part of
the trip where there is more delay.
- I use the option of Highlight the result by picking an option on top of the sheet.
3 – Flight activity in USA in 2015 by States and Airports.
- From this map we can see that the states with most quantity of flights are California
(CA) and Texas (TX) (Between 3.600 and 2.800 Flights per month approx.). The state
that follows is Florida (FL) with slightly less flights (Between 2.100 and 1.600 per
month approx.)
- Another two interesting states are Illinois (IL) and Georgia (GA). Both have very
active flow on their main Airports (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport –
AT and Chicago O'Hare International Airport – ORD)
Design:
- I use a Map to show the activity in USA in 2015 because is easier to find which state
or airport have more activity. Mixing the sizes and colours we can determine
whether the activity is high or low.
- For this particular comparison I use a dual Axis so we can see the data in the same
moment
- The option to choose the month of the year is available and I applied the alternative
of animate the map according the number of flights per month of the year.
